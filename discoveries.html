					<h2>Connecting Aquatic Food Webs to Land Use Change</h2><br>
					<p>					
					The land around lakes and rivers has long been known to funnel energy and nutrients downstream to support the growth of aquatic organisms.  However, a pressing question is how the reliance on these resources and subsequent productivity of aquatic organisms changes as surrounding lands are altered by human activities.  In 2014, we published the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5077">first study</a> demonstrating how the productivity of entire lake food webs varied with the type and amount of surrounding land cover.  The paper was highlighted by the UN in their landmark <a href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/f9d1e02c-3b53-4be8-9049-a03e6fd55640">Freshwater, Fish, and the Future report</a> and was featured on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/what-trees-talk-about">an episode</a> of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s (CBC) flagship TV series The Nature of Things.  CBC Kids even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cd5irO5ENU">broadcast a summary</a> of the paper for children.<br>
					<br>
					The 2014 study further catalysed intense debate on the importance of terrestrial resources between lab and field studies that culminated in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1601765">global synthesis</a> that we led with <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FM005968%2F1">funding from UKRI NERC</a>.  The work provided the first global test for cross-ecosystem resource fluxes in lakes and resolved the debate once and for all.  The novel methods behind these papers led to other important discoveries linking <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.2449">terrestrial base cation depletion to dramatic changes in lake food webs</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001389">patterns of human land use to microplastic pollution</a>,  and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26666-1"> forest disturbances as levers on land-water nutrient cycling</a>.

					<h2>Climate-Driven Shifts in Terrestrial Inputs Direct the Fate of Aquatic Carbon</h2><br>
					<p>					
					With funding from UKRI NERC, we established the <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FL006561%2F1">RELATED</a> experiment to predict how future shifts in terrestrial inputs associated with climate change will impact aquatic carbon cycling.  Our <a href="https://doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1588">approach to manipulate</a> lake sediments in the field was entirely novel.  We used RELATED to show that northward migration of plant species could <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04236-2">enhance methane concentrations in lake sediments</a> by >70% by changing the chemistry of decomposing litter.  This newly discovered climate feedback between shifting vegetation and microbial decomposition was highlighted in the film <a href="https://feedbackloopsclimate.com">Earth Emergency</a> narrated by Richard Gere and where we appear alongside leading climate scientists and activists such as Greta Thunberg, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and Jane Fonda.<br>
					<br>
					We later used RELATED to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904896116">discover that greenhouse gas concentrations</a> in lakes were more coupled to the chemical than <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14391">microbial diversity</a> of the environment and small-scale environmental variation was itself important for the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11370">development of microbial communities</a>.  We are now working to understand how carbon cycling depends on the molecular diversity of organic matter at a continental scale.

					<h2>Climate Warming Restructures Food Webs</h2><br>
					<p>					
					We have advanced understanding of the long-term impacts of climate warming in natural ecosystems, including how it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15347">restructures the biomass and phenology</a> of lake food webs and <a href= “https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.056">evolutionary arms races</a> between trees and seed predators.  By co-leading an international <a href ="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FS007857%2F1">NERC-funded network</a> on forest reproduction, we have tracked how forests are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15560">adapting to climate change</a>.<br>
					<br>
					Recently, we have returned to <a href=https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315885384>interdisciplinary Arctic research</a> to identify the consequences of thawing permafrost for the food webs that support human well-being.  We <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15756">discovered that</a> that despite more than half of the dissolved carbon in shallow groundwaters of peatlands being >1,000 years old, this material was largely absent from downstream food webs.  We are now tracking how microbes interact with "ancient" carbon released by thawing permafrost.<br>

					<h2>Explaining Why Biodiversity Varies Across Time and Space</h2><br>
					<p>					
					One of the most enduring mysteries in biology is why species vary so greatly in number across the Tree of Life and across geographic space.  Our group has discovered that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002792">uneven rates of evolution explain</a> why some flowering plant groups are extremely speciose (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-02001-x">highlighted in Nature</a>), identified the large-scale evolutionary processes that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau8067"> create global biodiversity hotspots</a>, and revealed why mountains are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01545-6">rich in biodiversity</a>.  Our research has also generated more practical <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/707207">knowledge on extinction threat</a> that can inform species conservation. To transfer knowledge into practice, we closely engage with world leading biodiversity conservation organisations at the <a href="https://www.cambridgeconservation.org/"> Cambridge Conservation Institute</a>.  We are now applying these approaches and tools to predict how species are adapting in response to global change and the implications for ecosystem health, such as water quality.
